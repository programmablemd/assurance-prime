# **Spry for Test Management**

Spry helps QA and Test Engineering teams **unify documentation,
automation, and execution** into a single, always-accurate workflow.
Instead of maintaining scattered test scripts, wiki pages, CI pipelines,
and notes, Spry allows you to write Markdown that is both **readable**
and **executable** --- keeping your test processes consistent,
automated, and audit-ready.

## What Spry Solves

Test workflows often become fragmented across tools, repos, and teams.
Spry fixes:

- Outdated test documentation\
- Manual steps in test execution\
- Test scripts stored without explanations\
- Lack of standard test-run procedures\
- No single place for evidence capture\
- Difficulty onboarding QA and new engineers

Spry ensures tests, execution buttons, and documentation all stay in
sync.

## Who Should Use Spry?

Spry is ideal for teams managing:

- Manual + automated testing\
- Regression test cycles\
- Playwright / Selenium / API test suites\
- QA operations\
- DevOps-driven test automation\
- CI/CD test runs\
- Evidence capture for audits (SOC 2, HIPAA, ISO)

## Why Spry for Test Management

- **Keeps test documentation executable & up to date**\
- **Unifies test scripts, workflows, and evidence**\
- **Accelerates QA cycles** through instant automation\
- **Reduces manual execution errors**\
- **Improves visibility** across QA, DevOps, and Production teams

## Unified QA Workflow With Spry

Spry ties all critical QA components together:

### Human-Readable Test Documentation

Describe test purpose, scope, and expected results in Markdown.

### Embedded Test Execution

Run Playwright, API tests, or CLI tools directly from the same file.

### Evidence Capture

Save logs, screenshots, and test output for audits or reviews.

### Reporting

Generate complete test execution reports automatically.

# **Core Test Management Tasks**

## **Run Playwright Tests**

### **Purpose:**

<!-- Execute all Playwright tests inside the `opsfolio` folder.

\`\`\`bash playwright-test -C PlaywrightTest --descr "Run Playwright
tests in the opsfolio folder" #!/usr/bin/env -S bash -->

# Navigate to the opsfolio directory

<!-- cd ../../../../opsfolio -->

## How To Run Tasks

# Run Playwright tests in the opsfolio folder

<!-- ```bash playwright-test -C PlaywrightTest --descr "Run Playwright tests in the opsfolio folder"
#!/usr/bin/env -S bash

# Navigate to the opsfolio directory
cd ../../../../opsfolio

# Installation and configuration
npm install
npx playwright install

# Run Playwright tests
npx playwright test


``` -->

# Surveilr Ingest Files

```bash ingest --descr "Ingest Files"
#!/usr/bin/env -S bash
# rm -rf resource-surveillance.sqlite.db
surveilr ingest files -r ./test-artifacts && surveilr orchestrate transform-markdown
```

# SQL query

```bash deploy -C --descr "Generate sqlpage_files table upsert SQL and push them to SQLite"
cat qualityfolio-json-etl.sql | sqlite3 resource-surveillance.sqlite.db
```

```bash prepare-sqlpage-dev --descr "Generate the dev-src.auto directory to work in SQLPage dev mode"
